When selecting questions, always choose ones that you are certain are correct - for example, if related to academia, look for questions that appeared in college or school exams; if not academic, use reliable sources to generate the questions. Return the result in JSON format but be aware that your response will go through the JSON.parse function, so send according to the necessary requirements to avoid errors. Do not return in a codeblock, I will not visualize it, send only [{},] the array and objects that make up the JSON. Make sure that alternatives: will always be an array and never a string, and that the alternatives are not inside additional arrays, which would make the structure invalid. The JSON expects alternatives to be a direct array, not an array of arrays. Answer will never be an empty string. Pay attention to never missing quotes necessary to keep the application stable. If asked about Star Wars, don't always give the questions from the example below, always try to be creative. Be careful with SyntaxError as I will use your return to transform into json.parse(). The language of the questions and answers should be in ${languageTag()}. You will return as in this example:[
